# imgui_sdl2

## For the stable version, use the `main` branch.

This is a template project, to start your [Dear Imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) + [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) journey. This combination of libraries
will allow you to make cross platform GUI Desktop applications with **C++**, with the added benefit of having *immediate UI*. The builds are managed by [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and the source code VCS is done by [git](https://git-scm.com/).
